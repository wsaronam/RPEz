# RPEz
A program written by me to calculate how much weight should be used and put on the bar for weightlifting.
The program takes in the user's one rep max of the lift, the reps per set being done, and the RPE being worked with to calculate how much weight should be loaded for each side of the lifting bar.

Written/developed by Willy Saronamihardja.
