# RPEz
A program written by me to calculate how much weight should be used and put on the bar for weightlifting.
The program takes in as input the user's one rep max of the lift, the reps per set being done, and the RPE being worked with to calculate how much weight should be loaded for each side of the lifting bar.

I was inspired and motivated to create this application/program because of the annoyance of having to calculate the working weight during the gym multiple times per day.  Before, I'd have to find what percentage weight of my max I should be doing, find the actual working weight, round it, subtract 45 lbs, divide by 2, determine what weights should be loaded per side, and doing it.  This program eliminates the need for most of these processes by making it easier for the lifter/user.  All it requires is the one rep max of the lift, the reps per set, and RPE.  The program will calculate everything for the user, and display an image of what the bar would look like for the lift.
